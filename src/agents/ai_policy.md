# Chromium AI Coding Policy

This policy is for Chromium developers using AI tools to help write code. It is
intended to outline expectations around the use of such tools.

## Responsibilities

Authors **must** self-review and understand all code (with or without AI
tooling) before sending it for review to ensure the correctness, design,
security properties, and style meet the standards of the project. Authors
should be able to answer questions reviewers have about the code. Beyond code
quality, Chromium has a strict 2-committer code review requirement and when the
author is a committer they are considered one of the two human reviewers. **Any
account that sends for review CLs which are not actually understood by the human
behind the account is at risk of losing their committer status.**

To aid reviewers, authors **should** flag areas that they are not confident about
that had AI assistance. This can be done in code review comments, the CL
description, or in code comments. There is a precedent for separating
automatically-generated code from manual edits with different patchsets (e.g.
patchset 1 has automatic changes and the reproduction instructions and patchset
2+ have manual edits) along with steps to reproduce the automated parts.

Authors **must** attest that the code they submit is their original creation,
regardless of whether AI tooling was used.

## Recommendations

Authors **may** explain in the CL description or the code base itself how AI tools
were used to produce the CL.

Examples:

*   If a single prompt to a tool (e.g. gemini-cli) was used to create the CL
    then the prompt may be included in the CL description.
*   If a design spec was provided along with a prompt as input to a tool that
    produced a working change, the spec may be checked in alongside the code and
    the prompt may be included in the CL description.

Additional examples for gemini-cli can be added to `//agents/prompts/eval`,
which will serve as eval cases for improvements to common system prompts.
