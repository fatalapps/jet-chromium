Tracing complete
Trace events and performance entries can be joined by navigationId.
-> id_0 hard-navigation (entry for text-lcp.html)
-> id_0 hard-lcp (entry)
-> id_0 LCP candidate (trace)

-> id_1 hard-navigation (entry for empty.html)

-> id_2 hard-navigation (entry for soft-navigations.html)

Soft navigations and bfcache restores cause small positive navigationId increments:
between id_2 and id_3:
-> increment is positive
-> increment is small
between id_3 and id_4:
-> increment is positive
-> increment is small
between id_4 and id_5:
-> increment is positive
-> increment is small
between id_0 and id_6:
-> increment is positive
-> increment is small
