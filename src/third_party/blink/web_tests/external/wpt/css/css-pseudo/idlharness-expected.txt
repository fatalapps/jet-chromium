This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] idl_test setup
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: window.getPseudoElements is not a function"
[FAIL] CSSPseudoElement must be primary interface of beforeElements.item(0)

[FAIL] Stringification of beforeElements.item(0)
  assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "ReferenceError: beforeElements is not defined"
