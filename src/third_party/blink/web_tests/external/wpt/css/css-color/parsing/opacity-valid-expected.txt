This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "clamp(50%, 0%, 70%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(50%)" but got "clamp(50%, 0%, 70%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "clamp(50%, 80%, 70%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(70%)" but got "clamp(50%, 80%, 70%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "clamp(50%, 60%, 70%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(60%)" but got "clamp(50%, 60%, 70%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "min(50%, 0%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(0%)" but got "min(50%, 0%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "min(0%, 50%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(0%)" but got "min(0%, 50%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "max(50%, 0%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(50%)" but got "max(50%, 0%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "max(0%, 50%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(50%)" but got "max(0%, 50%)"
[FAIL] e.style['opacity'] = "min(-40%, 50%)" should set the property value
  assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(-40%)" but got "min(-40%, 50%)"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
