This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] pad float32 3D tensor default options
  assert_less_than_equal: assert_array_approx_equals_ulp: test pad float32 actual 0 should be close enough to expected 22.76361846923828 by ULP distance: expected a number less than or equal to 0n but got 1102453732n
[FAIL] pad float32 4D tensor options.mode='edge'
  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'build' on 'MLGraphBuilder': The edge padding mode is not supported in tflite schema."
