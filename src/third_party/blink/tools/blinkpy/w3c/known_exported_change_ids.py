"""A set of Chromium Change-IDs that are known to have been successfully
exported to the upstream Web Platform Tests (WPT) repository, even if
Chromium's automated importer tooling might not correctly detect their
exported status from WPT's commit messages.

This set serves as a last-resort override primarily for the
Chromium WPT **importer** job and not the exporter job (more below).
When the importer identifies a Chromium Change-ID as needing to be
exported (e.g., because WPT's merged commit doesn't contain the
expected 'Cr-Commit-Position' or 'Change-Id' from Chromium's
perspective), but the change has actually been manually
verified as exported or needs to be ignored because it will not apply
cleanly, its Chromium Change-ID can be added to this set. This
allows the importer to proceed and not fail when trying to examine those
Change IDs.

Note about the WPT exporter job: The exported status is typically
managed by directly updating the GitHub Pull Request description
in WPT, which the exporter tooling already interprets correctly
even after the PR is merged.
