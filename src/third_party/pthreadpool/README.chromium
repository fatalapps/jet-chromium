Description:
pthreadpool is a portable and efficient thread pool implementation. It provides
similar functionality to #pragma omp parallel for, but with additional features.
This library supports //third_party/xnnpack, which in turn supports
//third_party/tflite.
chromium/jobs.cc implements a shim of `pthreadpool_parallelize()` that uses
Chromium Jobs API to schedule the parallel tasks with Chromium's ThreadPool
workers.
