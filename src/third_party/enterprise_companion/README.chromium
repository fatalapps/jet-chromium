Description:
The Chrome Enterprise Companion App (CECA) is built from Chromium source, but
placed into third_party to permit integration testing with version-skewed
binaries. New versions of CECA are automatically imported into CIPD by
the 3pp scripts in this directory, and //DEPS defines which versions of the
CECA are pulled from CIPD into the source checkout.

CIPD revisions are rolled to //DEPS automatically via
[Skia Autoroller](https://autoroll.skia.org/).
