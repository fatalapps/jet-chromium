# This script is used to apply patches that successfully compile from the
# 'rewrite-multiple-platforms.sh` script in the Chromium codebase, and then
# test on various gn configurations until a merged patch that is likely to
# compile successfully on the bots is generated.
#
# Prerequisites:
# --------------
# Ensure your .gclient contains:
# ```
# target_os = ["win", "android", "linux", "chromeos", "mac", "fuchsia"]
# solutions = [
#   {
#     ...
#     "custom_vars": {
#       "checkout_src_internal": True,
#       "download_remoteexec_cfg": True,
#       "checkout_pgo_profiles": True,
#       "checkout_mobile_internal": True,
#       "checkout_google_internal": True,
#     },
#  },
#]
# ```
# You'll also need to run some scripts like:
# ```
# build/linux/sysroot_scripts/install-sysroot.py --arch=arm
# build/linux/sysroot_scripts/install-sysroot.py --arch=arm64
# gclient sync -f -D
# ```
#
# Usage for automatic spanification
# ---------------------------------
# By running this script we can determine which patches work and compile
# on most (not 100% exhaustive) platforms.
#
# example
# 1. Checkout "main"
# 2. download a spanification patch: "rewrite" (or run at head) into your
#    ~/scratch directory
# 3. run this script to apply patches and figure out the set that compile on
#    all relevant platforms.
# 4. upload the patch and fix any tests or things this script missed.
