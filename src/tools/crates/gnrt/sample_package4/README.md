This is a sample Cargo package to test `gnrt`'s dependency resolution. The
output of `cargo metadata` is recorded and used as test data.

`tools/crates/gnrt/lib/test_metadata4.json` is generated by the output of
running `cargo metadata --format-version 1` in this directory.

This directory tries to repro the condition captured in
https://crbug.com/434775220: there is a target-arch-conditional dependency from
local package `foo` to the `prost-derive` crate (which in turn depends in
`anyhow`, `itertools`, etc.).

1. Such target-arch-condition should have no impact on `itertools`
   (because the `prost-derive` => `itertools` dependency is on host side)
2. Such target-arch-condition should have no impact on whether
   `prost-derive` target is present (i.e. on the `cargo_crate.gni`'s `enabled`
   property).  This is because `enabled` is calculated on host side.
