This directory contains resources used by WebSocket server for testing.
Multiple tests may share one resource, or URI handler.

- check-origin.html : A page which checks the origin header of the WebSocket
     opening handshake. The page is expected to be accessed via a file:// URL.

- close_observer.html : A page that creates a WebSocket connection to
     close-observer_wsh.py with role=observer and checks the contents of the
     message that is returned.
     Used by the SendCloseFrameWhenTabIsClosed browser test.

- connect_and_be_observed.html : A page that creates a WebSocket connection to
     close-observer_wsh.py with role=observed.
     This file does NOT close the established connection.
     Used by the SendCloseFrameWhenTabIsClosed browser test.

- connect_check.html : A page provides simple WebSocket connectivity check.
     This page changes page title to "PASS" to notify content::TitleWatcher.
     Used by ProxyBrowserTest.BasicAuthWSConnect,
     SSLUITest.TestWSSInvalidCertAndGoForward, SSLUITest.TestWSSClientCert,
     and SSLUITestIgnoreCertErrors.TestWSS.

- connect_to.html : A page which makes a connection to the WebSocket server
     specified in the "url" parameter,
     eg. connect_to.html?url=ws://localhost/echo Sets the title to "PASS" if
     connection succeeds and "FAIL" otherwise.

- multiple-connections.html : Verify that HTTP connection limits are not applied
     to WebSockets. Used by WebSocketBrowserTest.SSLConnectionLimit.

- split_packet_check.html : A page for testing split packet handling. Here,
     packets mean TCP segments for WebSocket, or SSL records for secure
     WebSocket. This page changes the title to "PASS" to notify
     content::TitleWatcher.
     Used by WebSocketBrowserTest.WebSocketSplitSegments and
     WebSocketBrowserTest.SecureWebSocketSplitRecords.
