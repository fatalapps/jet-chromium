 * @fileoverview SettingsViewMixin is meant to be inherited by parent or child
 * views belonging to a Settings plugin, to help with
 *  a) focus preservation during navigation
 *  b) search bubble showing during search
 *
 * If a parent view, need to override the following methods:
 *   - getFocusConfig(): Used when navigating 'back' to focus the correct
 *     element (the entry point to a child view).
 *   - getAssociatedControlFor(): Used by SearchableViewContainerMixin to query
 *     which element should be highlighted with a search bubble.
 *
 * If a child view, need to override the following method:
 *   - focusBackButton(): Called when navigating into a child view to focus the
 *     back button.
