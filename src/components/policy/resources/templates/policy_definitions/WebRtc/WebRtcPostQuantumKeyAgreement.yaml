caption: Enable post-quantum key agreement for WebRTC
default: null

  This policy allows controlling post-quantum key agreement for WebRTC.

  If this policy is set to Enabled, post-quantum key agreement would be offered for
  WebRTC.

  If this policy is set to Disabled, post-quantum key agreement would not be offered
  for WebRTC.

  If this policy is not set, the value would be set by the default rollout process
  for post-quantum key agreement offered for WebRTC.

  Offering a post-quantum key agreement is backwards-compatible. Existing DTLS
  peers and networking middleware are expected to ignore the new option and
  continue selecting previous options.

  However, devices that do not correctly implement DTLS may malfunction when
  offered the new option. For example, they may disconnect in response to
  unrecognized options or the resulting larger messages. Such devices are not
  post-quantum-ready and will interfere with an enterprise's post-quantum
  transition. If encountered, administrators should contact the vendor for a fix.

  This policy is a temporary measure and will be removed after some milestones.
