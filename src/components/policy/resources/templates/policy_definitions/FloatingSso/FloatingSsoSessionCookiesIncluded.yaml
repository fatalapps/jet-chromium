caption: Include session cookies in Floating SSO functionality
default: false
desc: |-
  By default, Floating SSO moves only persistent cookies between devices. This policy controls whether session cookies should also be included. It takes effect only when <ph name="FLOATING_SSO_ENABLED_POLICY_NAME">FloatingSsoEnabled</ph> policy is Enabled.

  When this policy is Enabled, Floating SSO will synchronize both session and persistent cookies.
  When this policy is Disabled or not set, Floating SSO will only synchronize persistent cookies.
