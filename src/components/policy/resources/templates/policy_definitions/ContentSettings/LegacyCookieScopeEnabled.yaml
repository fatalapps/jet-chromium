caption: Revert to legacy cookie scope behavior
default: 0
desc: |-
  This policy allows to revert back to the legacy behavior for cookie scoping.

  It means cookies set on a specific protocol (e.g. HTTPS) or port can be accessed from another.

  Setting the policy to Enabled, cookies will not be bound to their originating scheme and port.

  Setting the policy to Disabled or not set, cookies will behave with origin-bound scope.

  This configuration will only apply to top-level domains (e.g. example.com) and not to
  subdomains (e.g. sub.example.com).

  This policy will be removed in the future.
