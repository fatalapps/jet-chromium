caption: Allow ServiceWorker to dispatch navigation requests without waiting for its startup
desc: |-
  https://github.com/WICG/service-worker-auto-preload
  The ServiceWorkerAutoPreload feature dispatches a network request for a main resource at the same time it begins the ServiceWorker bootstrap process.

  Setting the policy to Enabled or leaving it unset means
  <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> enables ServiceWorkerAutoPreload. The navigation request is automatically dispatched while starting the ServiceWorker in some scenarios, e.g. ServiceWorker is not running,

  If it is disabled, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> will not enable ServiceWorkerAutoPreload. The navigation request is dispatched always after starting the ServiceWorker.

  This policy is a temporary measure to control the feature and will be removed in M144.
