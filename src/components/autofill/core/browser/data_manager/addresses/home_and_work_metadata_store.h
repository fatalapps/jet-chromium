// Home and Work profiles are downloaded through CONTACT_INFO but can currently
// not be uploaded there. As a result, syncing of metadata (e.g. use counts) is
// not possible like it is for regular account profiles.
// To support some kind of metadata sync for Home and Work, this class syncs the
// most important metadata through prefs. This is an awful workaround and to be
// removed once Home and Work metadata can be uploaded through CONTACT_INFO.
//
// The following metadata is supported:
// - use count
// - last use timestamp
// - A timestamp, indicating the modification time of the address when the user
//   removed it from Chrome. Once the address is modified outside of Chrome, it
//   will reappear.
//   Note that storing the modification timestamp instead of the time of removal
//   is preferred to avoid issues with incorrect system times.
//
// Ideally, all this logic would be integrated in the CONTACT_INFO sync bridge,
// as close to the sync support for non Home and Work addresses. However, since
// the bridge lives on a background thread and since writing prefs is only
// supported on the UI thread, it is integrated into the AddressDataManager for
// simplicity:
// - When profiles are loaded from the database, metadata changes are applied on
//   top of the result from the database.
// - When profiles are updated locally through the data manager, prefs are
//   updated.
// - When profiles are updated remotely, profiles are reloaded from the database
//   to apply any metadata changes.
